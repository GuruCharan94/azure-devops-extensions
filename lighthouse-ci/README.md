# Lighthouse CI

[Lighthouse CI](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci) is a set of commands that make continuously running, asserting, saving, and retrieving [Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse) results as easy as possible.
This extension runs Lighthouse CI as part of your Azure Pipelines.

## Getting Started with Lighthouse CI for Azure Devops

Once the extension is installed, you will see Lighthouse CI task that you can use in build / release pipelines. Below is a screenshot of a sample build pipeline.

![Lighthouse CI Sample Pipeline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuruCharan94/azure-devops-extensions/master/lighthouse-ci/images/demo-pipeline.png)

## Inputs

- Command - Dropdown where you choose one of Collect, Assert, Autorun or Upload.

- Configuration File - Path to the Lighthouse CI configuration file.
  
- CLI options - Command Line Arguments used to override options in configuration file.

- Artifact to Infer Build Context - Used by the task to override [Lighthouse CI's build context](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/blob/master/docs/cli.md#build-context) for `autorun` and `upload` commands. You can pretty much leave this blank for other commands.

  - **Build / YAML Multi-stage Pipelines** - When running the tasks inside mutli stage pipeline, the context is inferred from the Predefined variables listed in table below. Any value passed to this input is **ignored inside build pipelines**.

  - **Classic Release Pipeline** - When running the tasks *inside a release pipeline*, inferring context get slightly tricky. A release can have multiple artifacts of different types and so you have the option of choosing which artifact you would like to infer build context from. Leaving this blank will lead to the primary artifact of the pipeline being chosen as the one from which to infer build context from. If you want to point to a different artifact for this purpose, specify the **path to the root folder** of the chosen artifact. It usually looks like `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/_my_artifact)`.

## Build Context Override

The build context is set using the help of predefined variables from Azure Devops as shown in the table below. Take a look at pre defined [Build Variables](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/build/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml) and [Release Variables](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/release/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=batch)

| `LHCI_BUILD_CONTEXT__AUTHOR`             | `BUILD_BUILDNUMBER`                          | `RELEASE_RELEASENAME`
| `LHCI_BUILD_CONTEXT__EXTERNAL_BUILD_URL` | Link to the Executing Build `BUILD_BUILDID`  | `RELEASE_RELEASEWEBURL`

You can also override the below settings in the build context using variables of the same name in your Build / Release pipeline.

`LHCI_BUILD_CONTEXT__CURRENT_BRANCH`
`LHCI_BUILD_CONTEXT__GITHUB_REPO_SLUG`
