# Lighthouse CI

[Lighthouse CI](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci) is a set of commands that make continuously running, asserting, saving, and retrieving [Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse) results as easy as possible.

This extension runs Lighthouse CI as part of your Azure Pipelines.

## Getting Started with Lighthouse CI for Azure Devops

Once the extension is installed, you will see Lighthouse CI task that you can use in build / release pipelines. Below is a screenshot of a sample build pipeline.

![Lighthouse CI Sample Pipeline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuruCharan94/azure-devops-extensions/master/lighthouse-ci/images/demo-pipeline.png)

The `Command`, `Configuration File` and `CLI options` are fairly straight forward configurations and map directly to options you would pass to LHCI in the command line.

The input to `Artifact to Infer Build Context` is used by the task to override [Lighthouse CI's build context](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/blob/master/docs/cli.md#build-context) for `autorun` and `upload` options. You can pretty much leave this blank for other options.

- When running the tasks inside a build pipeline, the context is inferred from the Git Repo. **Any value passed to this input is ignored inside build pipelines.**

- When running the tasks **inside a release pipeline**, inferring context get slightly tricky. A release can have multiple artifacts of different types and so you have the option of choosing which artifact you would like to infer build context from.
  - Leaving this blank will lead to the primary artifact of the pipeline being chosen as the one from which to infer build context from.
  - If you want to point to a different artifact for this purpose, specify the **path to the root folder** of the chosen artifact.

The extension overrides the build context using predefined variables from Azure Devops as shown in the table below.

Take a look at pre defined [Build Variables](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/build/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml) and [Release Variables](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/release/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=batch)
